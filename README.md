# ‚òï Coffee Machine  

A **command-line Coffee Machine** program written in **Python** that simulates a coffee vending machine. It allows users to choose from different coffee types, process payments, and check available resources.

## üöÄ How It Works  
1. The user selects a coffee type (`espresso`, `latte`, or `cappuccino`).  
2. The machine checks if there are enough ingredients to make the coffee.  
3. If sufficient resources are available, the user is prompted to **insert coins**.  
4. If the inserted amount is sufficient, the coffee is dispensed, and change is returned if necessary.  
5. The user can also type **"report"** to view the remaining ingredients.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Run  
Make sure you have **Python installed**, then clone the repository and run the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coffee-machine.git
cd coffee-machine
python coffee_machine.py
